# Algolia Coding Challenge
This [coding challenge](https://github.com/algolia/solutions-hiring-assignment) was completed over a couple of days and it involved creating a mock interface using the Algolia search tool. I started out coding the traditional way by returning json from a local database, and once I had a working layout, I implemented the Algolia search library. First I had to compile the data from two files (json, csv) and save all the unique fields into a database. I used a traditional ajax/post script to access the database, returning json back to the client side. This gave me a proof-of-concept of how a normal client might have their site already set up. The output from the database was then piped into Algolia's servers in a json format to fully utilize the search tool. I did not finish hooking up a couple of the filters (stars, payment-options) and I also chose to host my answer on my website, rather than through github-pages.
