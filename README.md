# Algolia Coding Challenge
This [coding challenge](https://github.com/algolia/solutions-hiring-assignment) was completed over a couple of days and it involved creating a mock interface using the Algolia search tool. I started out coding the “traditional way” by returning json from a [local database](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/algolia-coding-challenge/blob/master/scripts/db.sql); once I had a working layout, I implemented the Algolia search library. First I had to compile the data from two files ([json](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/algolia-coding-challenge/blob/master/scripts/import_json.php), [csv](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/algolia-coding-challenge/blob/master/scripts/import_csv.php)) and save all the unique fields into a [database](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/algolia-coding-challenge/blob/master/scripts/db.sql). I used [ajax/post](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/algolia-coding-challenge/blob/master/inc/actions.php) scripts to access the database, returning json back to the client side. This gave me a proof-of-concept of how a normal client might have their site already set up. The output from the database was then piped into Algolia's servers in a json format to fully utilize the search tool. I managed to get most of the functionality working and had a lot of fun researching the possibilities. I did not finish hooking up a couple of the filters (stars, payment-options) and I also chose to host my answer on my website, rather than through github-pages.
